Changes to make:

-Collapse ProtoTorsion and AtomTorsion into one class. Best to do this by having ProtoTorsion replace AtomTorsion.
-Add new fields to Residue (those used in Sidechain Mutator including backbone atoms and Sidechain)
-Make library searches work with new AminoAcid class 
	-Need to determine if proline is cis or trans within library
	-Library will now take residue's
-Finish PeptideFactory to draw peptides 
	-Requires implementation of map between Elements and VDW parameters for OPLS calculations
-Eliminate unnecessary methods from Molecule (check out getOPLSenergy, isInteresting, normalize, shift, transform)
